WIP text emoji picker for Windows. It runs in the background, use `Win+Shift+I` to open it. The `list.txt` file must be in the executable directory.

## TODO
- Better `list.txt`. Currently the labels are pretty terrible...
- Add a Installer/uninstaller, with Run at startup option.
- User settings, customizable keybind.
- Icon :^)
- Preserve last location/size of window
- Bundle list.txt w/ installation, allow adding custom entries via UI.
